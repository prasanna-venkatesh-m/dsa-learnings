        //Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

        //The result format is in the following example.



        //Example 1:

        //Input: 
        //Activities table:
        //+------------+------------+
        //| sell_date  | product     |
        //+------------+------------+
        //| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
        //| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
        //| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
        //| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
        //| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
        //| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
        //| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
        //+------------+------------+
        //Output: 
        //+------------+----------+------------------------------+
        //| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
        //+------------+----------+------------------------------+
        //| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball, Headphone, T-shirt |
        //| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible, Pencil                 |
        //| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
        //+------------+----------+------------------------------+
        //Explanation: 
        //For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
        //For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
        //For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

        //        SELECT
        //e.sell_date,

        //STRING_AGG(product, ',') as products
